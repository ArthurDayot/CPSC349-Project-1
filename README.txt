Need to fix errors with login, add_topic.
Don't know if we need to fix add_answer until add_topic is fixed.
I updated register.php, header.php, add_answer.php, add_topic.php, view_topic.php, create_topic.php and the pettit.sql

Fixed login.php
Fixed register.php
Fixed add_topic.php
Centered header in header.php
Adjusted keys and added inserts in pettit.sql
Attempted to fix main_forum.php for backend, however cannot get posts to appear or be clickable
